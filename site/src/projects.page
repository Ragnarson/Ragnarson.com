      Statistics is a powerful tool when used properly. The only problem with
      statistics is sheer number of data you have to go through to get useful
      information.
    %p
      Tripsta generates around 30GB of search data throughout the day.
      This data is used to present users with flights of their choice and
      otherwise remains unused. However it is a source of valuable business
      intelligence - it just needs to be properly summarized.
    %p
      Major problem is amount of data. In addition each search result
      consists of a large tree of items with collections in both branches
      and leaves. Using SQL to store this means large normalization effort.
      Queries that get results from such database need to go through large
      number of joins making it slow and unmaintainable.
